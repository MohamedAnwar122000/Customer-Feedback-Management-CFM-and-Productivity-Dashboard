# **Customer Feedback Management (CFM) and Productivity Dashboard**

## **Project Purpose**
This project aims to design and develop dynamic, interactive dashboards for analyzing customer satisfaction (CSAT) and agent productivity. The dashboards provide actionable insights into customer feedback trends and agent performance, enabling data-driven decisions to improve operational efficiency and customer experience.

## **Dataset**
The project uses anonymized data provided for the test, including:
1. **CFM Data**: Customer satisfaction feedback, including CSAT scores, work arrangement details (Home vs. Office), and performance data by account, line of business (LOB), and agent.
2. **Productivity Data**: Metrics such as total calls, average handle time (AHT), break percentages, occupancy, and utilization rates.
3. **Active List**: Metadata linking agents to their respective teams, supervisors, and roles.

## **Key Questions Answered**
The dashboard is designed to answer critical business questions:
- What are the trends in customer satisfaction (monthly, weekly, and by work arrangement)?
- How does customer satisfaction vary by account, line of business, and agent performance?
- What are the key productivity metrics, and how do they vary by time, team, and role?
- How can we optimize agent productivity while maintaining high levels of customer satisfaction?
